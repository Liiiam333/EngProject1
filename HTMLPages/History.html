                        <li><p>The Greeks are often known as the origin of what we know as 
                            modern depictions of "love at first sight,” though as with all 
                            things with no known exact beginning, the emotion was likely 
                            around for much longer. Greek god Eros (later known as Cupid by the Romans) 
                            shot arrows that drove mortals crazy with love, and the myths were 
                            filled with stories of individuals falling in love often immediately.</p></li>
                         <li><p class="beBold">Romanticism</p></li>
                         <li><p>About a century after Shakespeare’s influential tragedies 
                            filled with love and heartbreak, the Romanticism Movement expanded 
                            and brought a large increase in modern “romances” in theater. 
                            It was during this time that some of the first cases the term, or 
                            very related dictation of the term, “love at first sight” was used. </p></li>

                        <li><p>Today, “love at first sight” stories are everywhere, and the term 
                            has become a widespread cultural topic likely millions (if not more) know of and follow. 
                            The romance genre is one of the most best-selling genres ever, and 
                            with help of modern media and the vast spread of knowledge throughout 
                            society, has taken over the way we base our own relationships with others.</p></li>
