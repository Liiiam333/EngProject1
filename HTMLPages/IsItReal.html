                        <li><p> When you do something good, your brain releases dopamine, causing 
                            you to want to do it again. Dopamine is also how addictions work. When 
                            you see somebody you like, your brain releases dopamine, creating a desire 
                            for more. Depending on how strong this initial sight is, these feelings may 
                            feel like love and is a large player in the science of love at first sight.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="beBold">Oxytocin</p></li>
                        <li><p> Oxytocin plays a role in controlling your body’s sexual functions and your 
                            emotions related to them. In terms of “love at first sight,” the hormone plays a 
                            similar role as dopamine. When you love somebody, oxytocin is large reason in why. 
                            It is what creates physical desire, or lust, and can be released when you see somebody 
                            you desire.</p></li>

                        <li><p> Love at first sight has also been acquainted with theories of evolution and as a 
                            past form of a survival mechanism. Your brain’s subconscious ability to latch onto traits 
                            of others that you feel desirable helps you secure a potential partner. </p></li>
