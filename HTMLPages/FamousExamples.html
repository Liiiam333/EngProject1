                        <li><p>Despite the play being written in 1597, Shakespeare’s Romeo and 
                            Juliet, a story about two “star-crossed lovers” who quite literally 
                            fall in love with each other at first sight, has become a household 
                            name representing said love at first sight. The story also, much like 
                            the other two on this list, ends with tragedy, highlighting both the 
                            ups and downs of love. </p></li>
                         <li><p class="beBold">Titanic</p></li>
                         <li><p>The Titanic, first shown in 1997 (coincidentally, by year, exactly 
                            four centuries after Romeo and Juliet), is often considered the most 
                            modern and well-known depiction of a love at first sight story. Although 
                            in some ways a simple story about two people who meet and find to love 
                            each other before disaster strikes (the ship sinking) and only one survives. 
                            It represents the sheer impact a well-made story about love can have in modern 
                            day, as it held top box office sales for over two decades, is still the fourth 
                            highest grossing film nearly three decades later and is only one of two 
                            movies produced before the year 2000 to be in the top 100 grossing movies 
                            (The Lion King taking place 54).  </p></li>

                        <li><p>While the other two examples here are fiction (or historical fiction), one 
                            of the oldest examples of love at first sight in the real world was with 
                            Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, and Mark Antony, Roman general and politician, from 
                            around 40-30 BCE. The two, although joined in some respects politically, came 
                            to love each other dearly to the point the two died by suicide after being defeated 
                            by Antony’s previous ally Octavian. Shakespeare also had an impact on the story 
                            with his own play, though the original story is still evidently very likely to be true.</p></li>
