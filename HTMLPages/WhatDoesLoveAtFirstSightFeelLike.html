                        <li><p>Step one of dealing with love at first sight is understanding exactly what it is. 
                            Describing love in itself and how it truly feels to be in love is difficult and goes 
                            as far back to our earliest civilizations. It is the emotion that is often referred to 
                            as a pinnacle of emotion, the shining peak of a mountain-though nearly every mountain 
                            has some jagged edge that can prove to be, although beautiful, deadly. So, the best way 
                            to identify love is to treat it like any other threat. Just as there are warnings for 
                            depression, watch for the days you are just that uncontrollably happy, and move on from 
                            there. In the case of love at first sight, that immediate urge to love is the same as an 
                            immediate plunge into the depths of depression.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="beBold">Step 2: Look at the Bigger Picture</p></li>
                        <li><p>Love at first sight is a real emotion, but as shown with many stories about the topic, it can 
                            go wrong. It is important to always take a step back and realize what is really going on. Once you 
                            identify what’s going on, don’t let emotion get ahead of your thoughts and cause you to make bad 
                            decisions, the same way you’re told to not do everything a friend tells you just because they are 
                            your friend. Rather see all angles of the situation and make sure you stay in the correct path you are on.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Despite any warnings, any emotion is not truly bad. Once you get through anything you will likely 
                            be the better person for it whether you know it or not. Continue your journey. Get to know the other 
                            person more than just that immediate click that brought you together. Just because you think they are 
                            the one, that, sadly, does not always mean you will for certain agree on everything, but that’s not a 
                            bad thing. Despite its lengthy history and time spent from both science and culture working to describe 
                            it, love at first sight is still a confusing topic. So, with a little reminder to stay on the right track, 
                            live your own story and maybe one day your life, no matter how miniscule, could be studied centuries in 
                            the future in hope to figure out the mystery of the topic still.</p></li>
